                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>When a few Japanese tourists gift Biniya a blue umbrella, she gains immense popularity. However, Nandakishore, the only shopkeeper in their village, tries to get his hands on her umbrella.</p>
                <h3>My Personal Opinion</h3>
                <p>This movie is really sweet. It is a Hindi movie. You can even show it to Aai Baba, they love these kinds of movies. You might find it a bit slow in places, but overall, it's nice. BTW, it is based on a novel with the same name as the movie, written by Ruskin Bond. </p>
