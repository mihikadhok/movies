                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Aladdin, a kind thief, woos Jasmine, the princess of Agrabah, with the help of Genie. When Jafar, the grand vizier, tries to usurp the king, Jasmine, Aladdin and Genie must stop him from succeeding.</p>
                <h3>My Personal Opinion</h3>
                <p>This movie is epic! The story is presented very beautifully. The genie's character is really awesome and funny. There are a lot of songs in the movie, since it is sort of a musical. Even if we know the story of Aladdin beforehand, the movie is quite enjoyable. I personally would like to watch it again.</p>
