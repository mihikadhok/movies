                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>While searching for her missing mother, intrepid teen Enola Holmes uses her sleuthing skills to outsmart big brother Sherlock and help a runaway lord.</p>
                <h3>My Personal Opinion</h3>
                <p>I quite liked this movie. The concept is a different one, as compared to the other movies you watch. It has adventure and mystery. I loved the character of a girl, she is so intelligent and brave, and I also loved the bond she and her mother share. Do give it a watch, I am sure you will enjoy it.</p>
