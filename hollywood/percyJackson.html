                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Percy must go on a quest to save his mother from the underworld and prove his innocence when he is accused of stealing lightning from Zeus.</p>
                <h3>My Personal Opinion</h3>
                <p>I enjoyed the movies quite a lot. It is NOT animated. The movie sets are beautiful. I had read the book, so I knew the story already. But you would understand it irrespective of book. The story is interesting, and it is a bit like Harry Potter, so I think you will like it. </p>
