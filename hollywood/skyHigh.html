                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Will, the son of The Commander and Jetstream, is enrolled in Sky High, a school for the children of superheroes. There, he discovers his true powers and learns about loyalty and friendship.</p>
                <h3>My Personal Opinion</h3>
                <p>This movie is a one time watch. It is set in a high school named Sky High. You might find the story a bit predictable, and some scenes a bit cheesy, but overall, it is an okay-okay movie. I found it a bit amateur, to be honest. Though I quite enjoyed the ending of the movie.</p>
