    <p>Dear Saveri, I have created this website specially for you, all by myself. Here, I have compiled movies for you, with their GDrive link, so that whenever you want to watch a movie, you can just visit this website and find a movie to watch according to your preference. </p>

    <p>Let me guide you through how to access a movie.</p>

    <p>As you can see, I have divided the movies in two categories, Hollywood and Bollywood. I have made a list of movies, along with a short description. You can scroll down the page, and after finding the movie you wnat to watch, click on the Open button corresponding to that movie. On clicking Open, you can find a detailed description of the movie, with some personal opinion of mine. On clicking the 'GDrive link to movie' button, you will directly be taken to the movie.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="justTryIt">Just try it!</p>

    <p>Ask me if you face any doubts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will keep updating the website as and when I find suitable movies for you, and will also keep adding some new features to the website whenever I can. You can also give me some suggestions and feedback regarding the website. Keep checking whenever you feel like watching a movie! (WITH AAI'S PERMISSION OF COURSE!!)</p>
    <p>Also, pardon me for the cheap and dull look of the website. I suck at designing. Maybe whenever I update the website, I might design it a bit better :)</p>

    <br>
    <p>Do you also want me to include GDrive links of all the movies you have watched earlier? To have some kind of recorded collection? Tell me if you want.</p>
